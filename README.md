# Mips Simulator
Provides a command-line interface simulator of the MIPS assembly language in stateless, functional Elixir.
To use, make sure you have Elixir and Mix installed, then navigate into the mips directory and run `iex -S mix` to compile and open the project with the iex shell.
See example `infile.txt`.
Parse a file with `Util.parse_file`, then pass into `Mips.run_instructions`.
